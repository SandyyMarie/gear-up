## Gear Up Pre-Work

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### What is the purpose of Gear Up in Mod 0?

* Reflect on intersectionality and how your identity impacts your experiences and interactions with others
* Develop greater empathy and awareness of the experiences of others in the field of software development

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Background Knowledge

Step 1: Watch this video from Google. 
* ["Unconconscious Bias at Work"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW5s_-Nl3JE)

Step 2: If you are unfamiliar with the term "Implicit Bias," take time to read this article to build your background knowledge. 
* ["PBS News Hour: Implicit Bias"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/making-people-aware-of-their-implicit-biases-doesnt-usually-change-minds-but-heres-what-does-work)

#### Reflect
Create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following questions:

* What were your reflections from the video?
  - That we all have unconsious Bias's but it's important to be aware and work against them. There's a thing you *think* you know about your users. I appreciated the concept that the biases create these invisible boundaries to what we're willing to explore.
  
* In what ways have you examined your implicit biases before coming to Turing?
  - I struggled with dealing with the implicit biases such that all the students would be young and fresh out of high school but I was pleasently surprised to meet my classmates that were within my age range and career changing no matter what stage they are in life

* What kind of software do you imagine building in the future? How will understanding biases (or avoiding understanding biases) impact your products?
  - I would like to help correct medical software and how convoluted the programs are. The biases that Iw ould struggle with would be preventing myself from assuming that everyone had the same type of tech exposure and education when growing up to be able to better understand and navigate programs.


#### READ

If you are unfamiliar with the term "Intersectionality," take time to read this article to understand the theory and introduction of the concept. If you are familiar, move to the reflection questions.  
* ["What's Intersectionality? Let These Scholars Explain the Theory and Its History"](https://time.com/5560575/intersectionality-theory/)

#### Reflect
On your same gist, reflect on the following quesitons:

<b>“All of us live complex lives that require a great deal of juggling for survival,” Carty and Mohanty said in an email. “What that means is that we are actually living at the intersections of overlapping systems of privilege and oppression.”</b>

 * When you consider the way you move through the world, what elements of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
 - I am constantly apprehensive about being a woman in this world, and secondly a hispanic woman.

 * What strengths does your identity give you?  How will you utilize those at Turing?
 - I think it helps bring a unique perspective and life experience that not many can say they've had. Being a woman won't really affect my time at turing but being hispanic will remind me to ensure my program instructions are easy to understand when possible.
 
 * How do you think you could value the identies of those around you to bring out their strengths at Turing? Has there been a time where you were able to advocate or include people around you?
 - I have needed to advocate from people such as my cousin with spina bifida because often people will ask others how she is feeling or if she needs something rather than asking her directly herself. I will always keep in mind to not assume and to make sure everyone gets their own voice.

 * How will your strengths impact you as a teammate?  What will you bring to your cohort? 
- I hope to bring life experience, including my experience so far as a woman in tech, to my career to better improve upon and add perspectives maybe others hadn't considered yet.
